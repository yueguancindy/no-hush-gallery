   			 <p>Is art itself really all that serious? I hope not - or at least not always. 
    I'm not sure that all that seriousness actually helps much. The idea that seriousness is somehow a measure of value and that art needs to be treated seriously all the time is a weird one. Much of the time, people value things that make them laugh, cry, scream, think or inspired - much more than they value the worthy and the serious. Therefore, I made this simulated, humorous art gallery experience because I want to understand how we look at art, value art, and translate art, in order to encourage alternative interpretations of artworks, connecting artist and audience by making them feel inspired to laugh, sing, dance, think differently.
